    Abstract = {The Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm is typically applied to data center and enterprise networks. We argue that SDN is also promising for rural wireless networks, especially those in developing regions. Operating a rural network in the developing world means coping with unpredictability, low profit margins, and resource constraints; the increased flexibility and simplified management that software-defined networks provide are a major benefit in this context. Network virtualization, also enabled by SDN, would allow rural networks to operate as infrastructure providers to existing ISPs, thus enabling cooperation rather than competition with powerful incumbent providers.}
