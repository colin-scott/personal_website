I'm a recent PhD graduate from UC Berkeley. In July 2016, I'll join Microsoft Research India to work on ICTD.<br/>
</br>
At Berkeley I was part of the <a href=https://netsys.cs.berkeley.edu>NetSys
  Group</a>. My dissertation was on testing and debugging networked systems. On
the side, I also collaborated with folks in the
<a href="http://tier.cs.berkeley.edu/drupal/">TIER group</a>. I worked with <a
    href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/shenker.html">Scott
    Shenker</a>, <a
    href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/arvind/">Arvind
    Krishnamurthy</a>, and <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~necula/">George
    Necula</a>.
</br>
</br>
In a previous life I studied philosophy and computer science at the
beautiful University of Washington. I spent most
of my time there working on <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/networking/astronomy/reverse-traceroute.html">Internet measurement</a> and
<a href="http://lifeguard.cs.washington.edu/">outage avoidance</a> with
<a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~katzbass/">Ethan Katz-Basset</a>,
<a href="http://david.choffnes.com/">Dave Choffnes</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/arvind">Arvind
    Krishnamurthy</a>, and <a
    href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/tom/">Tom
    Anderson</a>.
</br>
</br>
My graduate work was supported by an NSF Graduate Research <a
    href=http://www.nsfgrfp.org>Fellowship</a>.
