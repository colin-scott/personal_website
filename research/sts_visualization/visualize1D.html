This is a webpage for visualizing event traces. It's especially useful for debugging
non-deterministic replays by comparing the timings of different replay runs.

A common workflow:
  - Run ./simulator.py -c experiments/experiment_name/mcs_config.py
  - Discover that the final MCS does not trigger the bug.
  - Open visualize1D.html in a web browser.
  - Load the original trace, experiments/experiment_name/events.trace,
    as the first timeline.
  - Load the MCS trace, experiments/experiment_name_mcs/mcs.trace,
    as the second timeline.
  - Hover over events to see functional equivalence across the traces.
  - Load intermediate replay trace timelines if needed. Intermediate replay
    traces from delta debugging runs can be found in
    experiments/experiment_name_mcs/interreplay_*

TODO(cs): integrate our current hacked version of d3-timeline.js into the
public version so we can pull down updates.

TODO(cs): dynamically change the scale of the x-axis. Should just involve
changing the width parameter in visualize_lib.js (perhaps with a
jquery [slider](http://jqueryui.com/slider/) and redrawing the chart.

TODO(cs): allow the user filter out certain event types.

TODO(cs): newly recorded traces (as of July 14th, 2013) produce an error
"-infinity not a valid x position for circle". This must have something to do
with the way we're setting event.replay_time.
