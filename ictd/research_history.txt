 - High level point: I have a lot of experience debugging
   networks. This gave me a deep understanding of how complicated network
   management can be, and the need to make it automated for local
   entrepreneurs. 
   
   Subtext: I'm a mature(ing) researcher.

 - Specifically:
    * Working on reverse traceroute gave me the technical expertise needed
      to build large systems. This (helped) lead to an NSDI best paper, as well
      as the Gary Kildall departmental scholarship.

    * Working on LIFEGUARD taught me how to do independent research (asking the
      right questions, the importance of collaboration, how to run
      experiments, the importance of data, how to present results orally and
      on paper). This led to a CRA honorable mention and a best
      senior thesis award. LIFEGUARD is also a major component of our HotNets
      publication and NSDI submission.

    * Internship at Amazon taught me the importance of communicating with
      /users/ in order to identify important problems. Also taught me the
      value of getting feedback from peers.

    * Current project on debugging software-defined networks gives me a fairly
      in-depth understanding of the technology, especially its potential
      benefits and shortcomings.

    * Trip to South America (and Europe?) taught me a huge amount about
      cultural values => helped rid myself of naivete about development and
      technology.

    * I've given several talks in the past, in both academia and in industry.
      I learned that giving a good talk is HARD! And really important!

Intellectual Merit:
   - Lots of technical contributions in the past
   - Clearly know /how/ to do research

Broader impact:
   - A common theme of my research (learned from Ethan) is that it's crucial
     to find problems that are well motivated. Network operators
     care about reverse traceroute. Billions of under-privileged people care
     about network connectivity.
=================================================================================
TODO:
   - How did these experiences lead me to the realization of my research
     proposal? (Or rather, how did these experiences lead me to the realization
     of technical contributions of Yahel's problem?)
