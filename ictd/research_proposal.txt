- 70% of the world's population lives without Internet
  connectivity, mostly in rural regions. (Even in the United States! 30% of
  Americans don't have Internet access)

- Network connectivity is an excellent catalyst for economic + societal development.

- We observe that there exists little incentive to deploy networks in
  rural areas. At least two reasons:

   i.) Return on investment (ROI) is quite low for companies interested in
      expanding into rural areas. In particular:

      - CapEx is high: radio towers, antennas, solar panels, satellite links,
        etc. are relatively expensive

      - OpEx is high: managing network devices requires a high degree of technical
        expertise. Very few people have the skills, and those that do demand high
        pay. Moreover, companies have to invest much more in salesman catering to
        rural populations, since locals are slow to trust suits from the city with
        whom they aren't acquainted. // Moreover, retention is low: you can't simply
        // teach locals the requisite skills, since they will often just leave to
        // earn city wages elsewhere. 

      - Rural populations don't have much buying power.

      - Incumbent ISPs have bigger fish to fry: ROI is significantly higher in
        bigger markets, ISPs are focused on maximizing their profits => little
        interest

   ii.) Local entrepreneurs (who are trusted by their community, and highly
         motivated to obtain connectivity) are inhibited from deploying their own networks: 

       - Competition with incumbent ISPs crushes small businesses: initially entrepreneurs
         buy Internet connectivity from ISPs in the city -- as soon as you or your provider
         expand, you start competing for customers. This is a /very bad/
         business model => small businesses won't survive

       - As soon as they obtain customers, governmental regulations and customer
         expectations force them to start acting like an ISP:
         need TE, address allocation, caching, filtering, accounting, customer
         support, strict bookkeeping, etc.. These services are really hard
         to manage! Several of them also require expensive middleboxes.

 - We observe that trends in technology are bringing down CapEx requirements
   substantially (cf. dozens of papers on better MAC protocols for long-distance
   wifi, or AirJaldi using mountains rather than expensive radio towers.)

 - We argue that two technologies can be used to i.) significantly reduce OpEx
   and ii.) enable local entrepreneurs to deploy their own networks. In
   particular:

     * Software-defined networking (SDN) is a new network architecture
       designed to make management easy. [TBD: describe SDN in more depth]
       
       With SDN, it should be possible to make deploying networks /as easy/ as plugging
       in a home router: just point an antenna, and it should work. To make
       changes to the network, locals would feasibly only need to know how to click a
       button in a simple GUI. Monitoring, TE, routing, etc. could be handled in
       an automated fashion. 

     * Virtual circuits (VCs) would allow a decoupling of /network connectivity/
       from /network services/. Entrepreneurs could simply deploy access links.
       Customers would be given a /choice/ of which ISP in the city to buy Internet
       connectivity from; their traffic would then be transported transparently
       through a VC on the access link. The ISP would then handle the complex network
       services, and pay the entrepreneur for access to the customers. 

       // VCs also provide QOS guarantees, performance isolation, and
       // security isolation between customers sharing the network.       

 - It's not at all clear that these technologies will be sufficient!
     i.) SDN was perfected for the datacenter environment. Rural networks are a
      /radically/ different setting:
        * unreliable connectivity => controller will not be able to speak to
          the network devices at all times
        * WAN implies high latency between controller + routers => may not be
          able to react quickly enough to handle traffic spikes, etc.
        * The controller potentially has many more responsibilities than it
          would in the datacenter environment, with multiple WANs to manage,
          multiple tenants per network, highly dynamic workloads
        * Not immediately apparent that cheap wireless routers can support
          virtual circuits. Nor is it clear that the OpenFlow protocol
          suffices.
        * Need sophisticated monitoring capabilities so that when
          something goes wrong, the entrepreneur can immediately tell whether
          the problem is in his/her network or the ISP's.

     ii.) Not clear that SDN can enable /fully automated/ network management:
         * Although SDN clearly makes network management easier, it still
            requires technical expertise for both development and operation.
         * From an HCI perspective, not clear what primitives should be
           exposed on a management GUI

=================================================================================
Intellectual Merit:
   - We're pushing SDN to its limits along two dimensions:
      * Doubtful that network management can be made /completely/
        automated... need new controller hierarchies, abstractions
        for multi-tenancy, etc., before we get there. 

      * The deployment environment is very tough compared to
        datacenters... forcing ourselves to deal with unreliable links, high latency,
        etc. would teach us a lot about how to build SDNs

   - Not much previous research in this area! Most of the SDN focus has been on
     making /datacenter/ networks easier to manage -- not rural, resource
     constrained networks. 

Broader impact:
   - Sustainable business model enables deployment across the world, even in
     the U.S.!
   - Network connectivity obviously brings about positive educational, economic,
     societal changes.
   - The work fundamentally involves collaboration -- between network
     researchers, locals "on the ground", HCI researchers, etc. 
   - Need to communicate the results to technical and non-technical people
     around the world in order to get it adopted!
=================================================================================
TODO: 
  - literature survey on existing solutions
  - sketch out my proposed solutions the specific technical problems
  - enumerate expected results of research
  - How does this fit into the broader fields of networking and ICTD? Is this
    work `transformative'?
  - Inject and italicize specific keywords from the prompt. 
  - Diagrams?
